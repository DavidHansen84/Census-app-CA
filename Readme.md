I am really sorry if it is a little messy, I was in a hurry since 2 of my kids (5 and 7) was sick from monday and had to take them to the hospital on tuesday. Did not get home until thursday where they needed care. Friday I got sick and had to call an ambulance but it was OK and I could stay home but had to stay in bed. Took my laptop (witch I had nothin installed on of the studies or even vscode) and started there but had to install everything from scratch and troubleshoot what did not work and then just take it from there. So in reality I did this CA in just 2 days... I do not expect to be treated diffrently than the other students but just wanted to give an explanation.
